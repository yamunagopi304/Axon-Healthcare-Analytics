# 📊 Axon-Healthcare-Analytics

An interactive analytics project analyzing patient health, hospital performance, and healthcare KPIs using multiple tools — Excel, MySQL, Tableau, and Power BI. The dashboards provide KPIs, visualizations, and actionable insights into patient demographics, treatments, resource utilization, and overall healthcare efficiency.

📌 Overview

This project aims to showcase end-to-end healthcare analytics by building dashboards across Excel, Tableau, and Power BI, supported by SQL queries and Excel datasets. The dashboards highlight:

- Patient demographics (age, gender, region, health conditions)
- Hospital/department performance (admissions, treatments, occupancy)
- Key KPIs summarizing patient health and hospital efficiency
- Resource utilization patterns (beds, doctors, staff allocation)
- Trend analysis of admissions, treatments, and discharges

📂 Data Sources
